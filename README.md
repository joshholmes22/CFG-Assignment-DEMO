# CFG Assignment Demo

This repository is a **demo project** created to showcase assignment structures for CFG students.  
It’s designed as a reference only — there’s no actual content or solutions provided here.  
Use it as a guide for how to organise your own assignment submissions.

## Notes

- Each folder contains a **starter file** and a basic `README` with instructions.
- The aim is to help you understand **project organisation**, not to provide finished answers.
- Feel free to adapt the structure when working on your own tasks.
